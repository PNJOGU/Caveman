        <h1>Trading psychology</h1>
        <p>The main reason why most traders fail in this industry is that they ignore developing the necessary mental skills required to engage uncertainities, even when it becomes evident to him that the mindset he brought to trading is not working. Professional traders have acquired the probability mindset required in trading. I was a victim too and am endeavouring to better my mindset to make it a functional part of me. </p>

        <h2>Caveman&apos;s mindset</h2>
        <p>Caveman is a term coined by Mr. Rande Howell, a trading psychologist, referring to the ancient man who lived in caves and forests as recorded in our history books. The environment the caveman was exposed to consisted of dangerous wild animals that poised threat to the survival of human beings. Caveman would act in self defense whenever his brain would perceive the interaction with the wild animal as threatening. Through genetics, we have inherited that brain from caveman, and it comes to play whenever our brain perceives threatening situations.</p>
        <p>A common misconception that exists in the society states that <strong>&apos;We are thinking creatures&apos;</strong>. Human beings have both the emotional and thinking brains. I am certain that <strong>&apos;We are emotional beings who rationalize what the emotional brain has decided&apos;</strong>. The thinking brain only provides alibi to what the emotional brain has decided. No wonder, we often make decisions based on our emotions, only for our thinking brain to note later the actions. Emotions are simply biological in nature and often come into play when it interacts either positively or negatively with the external environment. This is how our brains function and successful people have learnt how to control their emotions from interfering with how they interact with markets and life in general</p>

        <h2>Probability Based Mindset</h2>
        <p>Trading financial instruments entails speculating  future price movements, where the outcome of our trades has a <strong>50%/50%</strong> chance of turning into a winner or a loser. The same way you flip a coin and take a guess of probable outcome, trading can be equated to engaging in a <strong>probability event</strong> with <strong>uncertain outcome</strong>. Our minds like associating what the environment is making known at that time, to what is already in the mind existing a belief. Beliefs have a strong energy capable of hindering us from being impartial at any given time. Professional traders have learnt to take present opportunities as <strong>unique events</strong> with a <strong>unique outcome</strong> as it enables them take trades from a <strong>carestate free mindset</strong> which allows them to perceive what the market is making available to them</p>
        <p>Below are the principles of consistency and fundamental truths about probalility based thinking discussed by <strong>Mr. Mark Douglas</strong> in his book <strong>Trading in the zone</strong></p>

          <h3>Fundamental truths of probability thinking</h3>
          <ul className='bgblue'>
            <li>At any given time, anything can happen</li>
            <li>You don&apos;t need to know what will happen next to make money</li>
            <li>There is a random distribution between wins and loses for a given set of variables that define an edge</li>
            <li>An edge is nothing more than a higher probability of one thing happening over another</li>
            <li>Every moment in the market is unique</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Principles of consistency</h3>
          <ul className='bgblue'>
            <li>Trader has to objectively define an edge as a methodology to use when trading </li>
            <li>He predefines risk before taking a trade</li>
            <li>He wholly accept the risk involved and is willing to let go of the trade</li>

        <h3>Remarks</h3>
        <p>Trading has to be the best endeavour in this world. It allows one to develop a mindset different from the one of the caveman. If you adopt a consitent approach to everything you partake on in life, I can guarantee you that you will become successful. Losing streaks will come, but with the right mindset you will overcome. I urge you to strive to build this new mindset and watch yourself transforming into a more desireble and powerful being. I have attached below books written by Mark and Rande, as they discuss deeply the topic of probability thinking in trading and how to acquire this new mindset.</p>
